# brain-tumor-segmentation

This project aims to implement a Python-based 3D Slicer module to perform segmentation on MRI images of glioblastoma tumors. SimpleITK is used to perform 2D and 3D filtering, and the program can be loaded as a 3D Slicer module by adding the location of the local repository to the "extra module paths" field in Slicer settings. SciPy and Numpy are also required.
